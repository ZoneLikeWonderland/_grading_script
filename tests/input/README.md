This place will be where you place the input to student program.
It should each be named `0`, `1`, `2`... with correspondence to those 
in `../output` directory.

If a given file does not exists, it will be `touch`ed and an empty file 
will be passed to the student program. 

If you changed how `grade`/`run` works, you are free to define your own
test case storage.
