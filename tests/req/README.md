This directory stores the resource constraint of each test case.

Each file should be named the same as they are named in `../input/`
directory.
They should be space delimited value of CPU time, Real CPU time, and 
memory usage, e.g. `16 16 256` stands for 16 seconds of CPU time, 16
seconds of Real CPU time, and 256MB of memory.

The `default` file in this directory specify a default for all test cases.
